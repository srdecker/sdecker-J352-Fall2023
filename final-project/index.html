        <h2>Eva Gunnare is trying to restore people’s relationship with nature — by teaching them how to forage.</h2>

        <p><i>This story has been reproduced as part of coursework for the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland. It was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/15/travel/sweden-foraging-eva-gunnare.html">originally published on The New York Times</a>.</i></p>
            
        <p><span class="drop">A</span> pot of birch sap simmered on Eva Gunnare’s stove. It was an early morning in May in Jokkmokk, a small Swedish town in the Arctic Circle, and outside the snow was melting. On the table sat a plate of cookies made with dried bilberries, a native fruit that Ms. Gunnare had foraged the previous season.</p>
        
        <p>“Most Swedish people eat blueberries imported from abroad,” she said, pouring some sap into a small shot glass. “They do not know we have these delicious bilberries in our own backyard.”</p>

        <p>For over a decade, Ms. Gunnare, a 56-year-old Swedish woman, has been trying to restore people’s relationship with nature by teaching them how to forage. Through her lessons on picking wild herbs, identifying edible plants and making dandelion honey, among many others, she aims to help locals and foreign visitors alike better understand nature.</p>

        <p>Her approach differs from other tourist operators in the region, who often focus on outdoor expeditions such as trekking or skimobiling. These, Ms. Gunnare believes, do not always help people better understand or respect their environment.</p>
