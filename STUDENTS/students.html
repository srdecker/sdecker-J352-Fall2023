  <p>Roughly one-fifth of recent graduates, 21%, are working in jobs, either full or part-time, that arenâ€™t related to their major area of study. Among those who are working in their field of study, another 21% are currently working part-time. Less than half of recent graduates, 47%, have been able to secure full-time employment in a job related to what they studied in college. </p>
